# Mindex-Code-Challenge

I was not familiar with Spring, MongoDB, or JUnit when I began this project. I did my best to piece together something that works based on some YouTube tutorials. However, I have a lot to learn. Moving forward, I plan on taking some courses on these subjects. This project was a good experience and good exposure to these topics. I appreciate the time Mindex gave me for this.
